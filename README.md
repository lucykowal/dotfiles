### neovim

a distant relative of [kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)
with many mutations.

based on a split-heavy post-IDE workflow. perma-zen mode & fuzzy finders. i'm
very particular about my tools. i need a level of consistency, so that's what
i've tried to set up here. expect consistent ui and ux where ever possible.
copilot integration for chat and completions, supercollider support,

**to-do**:

- fix copilot `#` suggestions
- improve handling of supercollider help buffers
- evaluate value of floating terminal v.s. built-in `:term`
