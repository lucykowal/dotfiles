# nvim

My modified version of [kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) for neovim. Prioritizes the readability of the buffer above all else, by configuring most pop up windows to open non-obtrusively to the side.

### Key Map Cheatsheet

Some default & customized key maps, so that I don't forget!
